#Log 1 
Hi! :)) 
This project is a continuation/spin-off of a previous project of mine. I originally intended to just make a directory  
of climbing spots in the area, but after all was said and done I was a bit dissatisfied so I've decided to aim bigger and pretty   
much start from scratch. My endgoal for this project is to create a social media site for climbers to connect with eachother and share their climbs.  
These logs will serve as my medium for going more in depth with certain design choices as well as walking through any features I may add and sort of documenting the journey of this project. Basically this is my way of keeping the README short.
