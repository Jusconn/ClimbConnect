Hi, This is my first real update on how the project is going. I've figured out  
what I would like the app features to be and I've made some mockups of the home page  
and profile screen using Figma. You can view the demo here https://www.figma.com/proto/OJ9t8eYSFwxkf7SWzAznLF/Boulder-App-UI?type=design&node-id=48-848&t=EEmg3pzKBNhOG174-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=5%3A2&mode=design
